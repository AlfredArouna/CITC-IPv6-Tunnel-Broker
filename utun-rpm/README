Hello,

this is directory structure for building RPM/SRPM of utun kernel module for
IPv6 over UDP/IPv4 transport.

Run 
     rpmbuild -ba --target=`uname -m` SPECS/kmod-utun.spec 2> build-err.log | tee build-out.log

or similar in your RPM-build top directory to produce files
     ./RPMS/i686/kmod-utun-1.0-1.el6.i686.rpm
     ./SRPMS/kmod-utun-1.0-1.el6.src.rpm

After this, you can install the module RPM with command
     rpm -ivh ./RPMS/i686/kmod-utun-1.0-1.el6.i686.rpm

and insert it into kernel with
     modprobe utun

or get info with
     modinfo utun


Enjoy.
